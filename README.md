  ============

#### Mastering Big O notation
[Here's a Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

n = size of the input

Time Type | big o | plain english
---|---|---
Constant Time | O(1) | One wrapped around Big O
Logarithmic Time | O(log(n)) | Big O of log of n
Linear Time | O(n) | n
Linearthmic Time | O(nlog(n)) |
Quadric Time | O(n^2) | n radius (to the power )
Cubic Time | O(n^^3) | n radius (to the power )
Exponential Time | O(b^n), b >1
Factorial Time | O(n!) | n factorial

- It only cares about when N is really big!
- It only cares about the worse case
