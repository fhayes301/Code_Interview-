# Common Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort O(n^2) - memory O(1)
  start at the beginning of the array and swap the first two elements if the first is greater than the second. Then, go to the next pair and so on. The smaller items 'bubble up' to the beginning.

- Selection Sort O(n^2) - memory O(1)
  largely inneficient. does a linear scan to find the smallest item and pushes to front. does that over and over.

- Merge Sort O(n log(n)) - memory depends
  merge sort divides the array in half, sorts each of those halves, and then merges back together. HUH?

- Quick Sort O(n log(n)) average, O(n^2) worst case, memory: O(log(n))
  pick a random element and partition the array such that all numbers that are less than the partitioning element come before all elements that are greater than it.

- Radix Sort O(kn)
